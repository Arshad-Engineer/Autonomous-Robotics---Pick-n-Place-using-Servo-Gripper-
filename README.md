# Autonomous-Robotics---Pick-n-Place-using-Servo-Gripper-
This project explores the use of the Raspberry Pi GPIO library to generate PWM signals for control of a servo motor & gripper assembly
 This task begins to investigate the implementation of localization theory as applied to our robot vehicles
 The codes developed in this task, willbe implemented into the autonomy algorithms used by our robot vehicles
